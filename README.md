## The best word embeddings you can use

ConceptNet Numberbatch consists of state-of-the-art semantic vectors (also
known as word embeddings) that can be used directly as a representation of word
meanings or as a starting point for further machine learning.

ConceptNet Numberbatch is part of the [ConceptNet](http://conceptnet.io) open data
project. ConceptNet provides lots of ways to compute with word meanings, one of which
is word embeddings. ConceptNet Numberbatch is a snapshot of just the word embeddings.

It is built using an ensemble that combines data from ConceptNet, word2vec,
GloVe, and OpenSubtitles 2016, using a variation on retrofitting. It is
described in the paper [ConceptNet 5.5: An Open Multilingual Graph of General
Knowledge][cn55-paper], presented at AAAI 2017.


### Evaluation and publications

ConceptNet Numberbatch took first place in both subtasks at SemEval 2017 task
2, "[Multilingual and Cross-lingual Semantic Word Similarity][semeval17-2]".
Within that task, it was also the first-place system in each of English,
German, Italian, and Spanish. The result is described in our ACL 2017 SemEval
paper, "[Extending Word Embeddings with Multilingual Relational Knowledge][semeval-paper]".

[semeval17-2]: http://alt.qcri.org/semeval2017/task2/
[semeval-paper]: https://arxiv.org/abs/1704.03560

The code and papers were created as a research project of [Luminoso
Technologies, Inc.][luminoso], by Robyn Speer, Joshua Chin, Catherine Havasi, and
Joanna Lowry-Duda.

### Now with more fairness

Word embeddings are prone to learn human-like stereotypes and prejudices.
ConceptNet Numberbatch 17.04 counteracts this as part of its build process,
leading to word vectors that are less prejudiced than competitors such as
word2vec and GloVe. See [our blog post on reducing
bias](https://blog.conceptnet.io/2017/04/24/conceptnet-numberbatch-17-04-better-less-stereotyped-word-vectors/).

## Code

Since 2016, the code for building ConceptNet Numberbatch is part of the [ConceptNet
code base][conceptnet5], in the `conceptnet5.vectors` package.

A preliminary paper we put on arXiV in April 2016 described the ConceptNet
Vector Ensemble, a previous version of this system. The code for that version
is still available in the `16.04` branch:

  https://github.com/commonsense/conceptnet-numberbatch/tree/16.04

The only code contained in _this_ repository is `text_to_uri.py`, which normalizes natural-language text into
the ConceptNet URI representation, allowing you to look up rows in these tables without requiring the entire
ConceptNet codebase. For all other purposes, please refer to the [ConceptNet code][conceptnet5].

[ConceptNet Numberbatch 17.06][nb1706-main] is the current recommended download.

This table lists the downloads and formats available for multiple recent versions:

The 16.09 version was the version published at AAAI 2017. You can reproduce its results using a Docker snapshot of the conceptnet5 repository.

The .txt.gz files of term vectors are in the text format used by word2vec, GloVe, and fastText.

The first line of the file contains the dimensions of the matrix:

    1984681 300

Each line contains a term label followed by 300 floating-point numbers,
separated by spaces:

    /c/en/absolute_value -0.0847 -0.1316 -0.0800 -0.0708 -0.2514 -0.1687 -...
    /c/en/absolute_zero 0.0056 -0.0051 0.0332 -0.1525 -0.0955 -0.0902 0.07...

    /c/en/absolutely_convergent 0.3752 0.1087 -0.1299 -0.0796 -0.2753 -0.1...

The HDF5 files are the format that ConceptNet uses internally. They are data
tables that can be loaded into Python using a library such as `pandas` or
`pytables`. The "mini.h5" files trade off a little bit of accuracy for a lot of
memory savings, taking up less than 150 MB in RAM, and are used to power the
[ConceptNet API](https://github.com/commonsense/conceptnet5/wiki/API).

## Language statistics

The multilingual data in ConceptNet Numberbatch represents 78 different language
codes, though some have vocabularies with much more coverage than others. The following
table lists the languages and their vocabulary size.

You may notice a focus on even the smaller and historical languages of Europe,
and under-representation of widely-spoken languages from outside Europe, which
is an effect of the availability of linguistic resources for these languages.
We would like to change this, but it requires finding good source data for
ConceptNet in these under-represented languages.

These vocabulary sizes were last updated for ConceptNet Numberbatch 17.02.
