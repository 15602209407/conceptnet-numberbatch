# Guidelines for putting things in this file:
#
# - Google Scholar can usually give you the BibTeX data for any paper.
#   It usually provides a reasonable-looking ID of the form
#   [author name][year][keyword], so let's follow this format as much as
#   possible. The keyword it picks is the first word of the title; you
#   can change it to something more memorable.
#
# - Add a 'url' entry indicating where you can read the paper online.
#
# - Add a 'comment' entry indicating why the paper is important and what key
#   ideas we should cite it for.
#
# - Try to keep the papers organized into sections, so we know where to look
#   when writing about particular topics.
#
# - Try to keep each section in chronological order, at least by year.

  comment={
    This is a survey of word similarity methods and how they perform with
    different parameter settings, aiming to "compare apples to apples" when
    evaluating the claims of word2vec and GloVe.

    One thing it examines is the effect of L2-normalizing the columns of GloVe.

    It also implements a method based on the SVD of the pointwise mutual
    information matrix, which achieves the best score I've seen on the
    rare words dataset, besides ours (rho=.514).

    This is the paper underlying what eventually became Luminoso, though our
    methods have changed significantly.

    The paper describes the "blending" operation in particular, which is how
    we combine ConceptNet with domain-specific co-occurrences.

    Don't go looking in this paper for any kind of evaluation that can be
    compared to anything else; the only task we evaluated was to infer
    ConceptNet-like assertions.
